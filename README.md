# Homebrew Multi-Sig Ethereum Wallet

This is my first take on a multi-sig Ethereum wallet, built from the ground up using Moralis + Web3 + React.



#### SETUP
Adjust Custodian accounts in `MultiSig.sol`


#### DEPLOY
Deploy contract to your favorite EVM chain (Ethereum, Polygon, etc.)

#### USE
* Raise a new proposal
* View Custodian accounts for the contract
* View Historic Proposal outcomes
* Address Book with ENS support (coming soon) -- USE THIS WITH GREAT CAUTION AND ALWAYS DOUBLE-CHECK ALL ADDRESSES BEFORE SENDING!!
*
